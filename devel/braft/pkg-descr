An industrial-grade C++ implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm and
replicated state machine based on brpc. braft is designed and
implemented for scenarios demanding for high workload and low overhead
of latency, with the consideration for easy-to-understand concepts so
that engineers inside Baidu can build their own distributed systems
individually and correctly.
